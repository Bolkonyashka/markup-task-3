                <h2 class="big-article-header">Do Whales Sleep?</h2>
                <p class="article-text two-columns-text" lang="en">
                    Whales are mammals, so in many ways, they are just like 
                    human beings. 
                    The most important difference is that humans and whales 
                    live in different environments 
                    and whales have a special respiratory system that enables 
                    them to stay underwater for 
                    several minutes without breathing oxygen. For this reason, 
                    they are said to be voluntary 
                    breathers. That is, because of whales’ underwater environment, 
                    they must be conscious 
                    breathers. They think about every breath they take and come 
                    up to the surface of the 
                    water to breathe through 
                    blowholes on top of their heads.
                    What is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. 
                    While all mammals sleep, whales cannot 
                    afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. 
                    The only way they can sleep is by remaining 
                    partially conscious. It is believed that only one hemisphere 
                    of the whale’s brain sleeps at a time, so they 
                    rest but are never completely asleep. They can do so most 
                    probably near the surface so that they can come up 
                    for air easily.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p class="article-text" lang="en">
                    Education encompasses both the teaching and learning of knowledge, 
                    proper conduct, and technical 
                    competency. It thus focuses on the cultivation of skills, trades 
                    or professions, as well as mental, 
                    moral and aesthetic development. 
                    Formal education consists of systematic instruction, teaching and 
                    training by professional teachers. 
                    This consists of the application of pedagogy and the development 
                    of curricula.
                    The right to education is a fundamental human right. Since 1952, 
                    Article 2 of the first Protocol to the 
                    European Convention on Human Rights obliges all signatory parties 
                    to guarantee the right to education. 
                    At world level, the United Nations’ International Covenant on 
                    Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 
                    1966 guarantees this right under its Article 13.
                    Educational systems are established to provide education and 
                    training, often for children and the young. 
                    A curriculum defines what students should know, understand and 
                    be able to do as the result of education. 
                    A system of policies, regulations, examinations, structures and 
                    funding enables teachers to teach to the 
                    best of their abilities. Sometimes educational systems can be 
                    used to promote doctrines or ideals as well 
                    as knowledge, which is known as social engineering. This can 
                    lead to political abuse of the system, 
                    particularly in totalitarian states and government.
                    Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first years of 
                    formal, structured education. In general, 
                    primary education consists of six or seven years of schooling 
                    starting at the age of 5 or 6, although this 
                    varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 
                    70% of primary-age children are enrolled in 
                    primary education, and this proportion is rising.
                    In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary 
                    education consists of the second years of 
                    formal education that occur during adolescence. It is characterized by 
                    transition from the typically compulsory, 
                    comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective 
                    tertiary, “post-secondary”, or “higher” 
                    education (e.g., university, vocational school) for adults.
                    Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary 
                    education, is the non-compulsory 
                    educational level that follows the completion of a school providing 
                    a secondary education, such as a high 
                    school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to 
                    include undergraduate and postgraduate 
                    education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges 
                    and universities are the main institutions 
                    that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes 
                    known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary 
                    education generally results in the receipt of certificates, 
                    diplomas, or academic degrees.

                    The butterfly effect concept has become important in the finance 
                    world as globalization continues 
                    to increase and capital markets connect. Volatility in one small area of 
                    the international markets 
                    can grow rapidly and bleed into other markets, and a hiccup in one corner 
                    of the international markets 
                    can have global consequences. Improvements in technology and wider access 
                    to the Internet has increased 
                    the degree to which international markets influence each other. This has 
                    led to more episodes of extreme 
                    market volatility.
                    The butterfly effect has become well-known in popular culture, and the 
                    concept has clear applications to 
                    finance. It and chaos theory may provide a partial explanation for the

                    Christmas which is celebrated on December 25th is an important Christian holiday. 
                    The origin of the word 
                    “Christmas” comes from “Christ” and the “Holy Mass”. It is believed that the day 
                    commemorates the birth of 
                    Jesus Christ although a lot of people doubt that the Day corresponds to the actual 
                    date of his birth. In spite 
                    of its Christian origin, Christmas is also celebrated by a lot of non Christian 
                    countries and the celebration 
                    includes a lot of non religious customs. People exchange gifts and greeting cards. 
                    Homes are decorated with 
                    Christmas trees, light and garlands. Dinners are planned with special food and all 
                    the families gather to have 
                    a lot of fun.
                    A central imaginary figure in Christmas is Father Christmas, also called Santa Claus. 
                    He is believed to fly 
                    on his sleigh bringing gifts for children.
                    Christmas is also an opportunity for economic growth. It has become an important 
                    period for business activity. 
                    Shops make a lot of profit and a lot of countries realized this economic impact.

                <h2>Juvenile Crime</h2>
                <aside class="vertical-text">Importantly</aside>
                <p class="article-text" lang="en">
                        Juvenile delinquency refers to antisocial or illegal behavior by 
                        children or adolescents and is 
                        considered a serious problem all over the world. It is caused by 
                        social, economic and cultural factors. 
                        This juvenile criminality is apparent in marginal sectors of urban 
                        areas where children are exposed to 
                        violence in their immediate social environment, either as observers 
                        or as victims. Because delinquents 
                        basic education, if they have any, is poor they have been marginalized 
                        from society and destitute of any 
                        dignity or self esteem. Although most legal systems prescribe specific 
                        procedures for dealing with young 
                        criminals, such as juvenile detention centers, approaches to prevent 
                        youth from becoming delinquent should 
                        also include measures to instill equality and justice, fight poverty 
                        and create an atmosphere of hope and 
                        peace among youth. These preventive policies should be given priorities 
                        over any coercive measures.
                        Socioeconomic opportunities and administrative services should be 
                        provided in rural areas to discourage 
                        young people from migrating to urban areas. Similarly, youth from 
                        poor urban settlements should benefit 
                        from plans that focus on education, employment and access to leisure programs, 
                        especially during long 
                        school holidays. Young people who drop out of school or come from broken 
                        families should have access to 
                        specific social programs that help them become responsible adults.
                        Information campaigns should be planned that youth to be aware of 
                        the detrimental effects of violence 
                        on the family, community and society, to teach them how to 
                        communicate without violence. Focus on the 
                        importance of family should become a priority 
                        because it is the primary institution of socialization of 
                        youth and continues to play an important role in the prevention of underage crime.
